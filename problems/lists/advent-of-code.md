# Advent of Code: Lists

We suggest working through the following Advent of Code problems:

## 2019: Day #1

- [Problem statement](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1)
- [Starter code](aoc2019-01.py)

## 2020: Day #1

- [Problem statement](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)
- [Starter code](aoc2020-01.py)

## 2020: Day #2

- [Problem statement](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)
- [Starter code](aoc2020-02.py)

Note: this problem also involves some string processing.

## 2019: Day #4

- [Problem statement](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4)
- [Starter code](aoc2019-04.py)

Note: This is a slightly challenging problem, but one that can really help you gain a solid understanding of lists.

## 2020: Day #13 [Task 1 only]

- [Problem statement](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/13)
- [Starter code](aoc2020-13.py)

Note: Task 2 involves higher math that we would not expect you to know in an introductory programming class.
