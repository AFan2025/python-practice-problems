# Short Exercises: Lists

### Exercise #1

**File**: [count_greater_than_val.py](count_greater_than_val.py)

Given a list of integers ``lst`` and a variable ``val``, write a loop to count the number of values in the list that are strictly greater than ``val``. For example, given the list ``[-1, -2, -3, -4]`` and ``0`` for ``val``, the result would be zero because there are no values that are strictly greater than zero in the list.

### Exercise #2

**File**: [negate_list.py](negate_list.py)

Given a list of integers ``lst``, create a *new* list with its values negated. For example, given list ``[-1, 2, -3, 4]``, the result should be this *new* list: ``[1, -2, 3, -4]``
