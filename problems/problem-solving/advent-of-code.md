# Advent of Code: Problem Solving

We suggest working through the following Advent of Code problems:

## 2019: Day #3

- [Problem statement](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3)
- [Starter code](aoc2019-03.py)

Hint: Despite how the problem is stated, you should avoid approaching it as a list-of-lists problem. Instead of creating a grid to “draw” the wires on, think instead about how you could keep track of the coordinates that a wire goes through.
